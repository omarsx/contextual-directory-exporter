### Features

* **Customizable Exclusions**: Easily exclude specific directories (e.g., node_modules, .git, dist) from the export.
* **Metadata Enrichment**: Generates metadata including:
* Generation timestamp with timezone and milliseconds.
* Source and target directories.
* Output filename.
* Skipped directories with counts of skipped files.
* **Interactive Prompts**: Minimal GUI-like interaction in the terminal for user-friendly operation.
* **Detailed Logging and Error Handling**: Provides informative messages and handles errors gracefully.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux) with Bash 4.0+.

### Prerequisites

* **Bash**: Version 4.0 or higher.
* *Note*: macOS users may need to install Bash 5 since the default Bash version is 3.x.
* **tree**: Utility for generating directory trees.
* **jq**: Command-line JSON processor.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Bash 5 (for macOS users)**

Install via Homebrew:

brew install bash

Verify installation:

bash --version

Ensure that Bash 5 is used when running the script:

/usr/local/bin/bash script.sh

#### tree and jq

Install via Homebrew:

brew install tree jq

Verify installations:

tree --version
jq --version

### Installation

 1. **Clone the Repository**

git clone <https://github.com/omarsx/contextual-directory-exporter.git>
cd contextual-directory-exporter

 2. **Make the Script Executable**

chmod +x script.sh

### Usage

 1. **Run the Script**

* If Bash 5 is not your default shell, run:

/usr/local/bin/bash script.sh

* If Bash 5 is your default shell, run:

./script.sh

 2. **Follow the Interactive Prompts**

* **Enter the source directory**: Provide the full path to the directory you want to export.
* **Enter the target directory for the export**: Provide the full path where you want the JSON output file to be saved.
* If the target directory does not exist, you will be prompted to create it.

 3. **Script Execution**

* The script will generate the directory structure, analyze skipped directories, and combine data into a final JSON file.
* Upon success, you will see a message:

âœ… Success! This script was developed by <https://github.com/omarsx>. Please consider a star!

 4. **View the Output**

* Navigate to the target directory you specified.
* The output JSON file will be named in the format:

directory_export_<Month>_<Day>__<Hour>-<Minute>-<AM/PM>_PKT.json

Example:

directory_export_Nov_03__02-14-AM_PKT.json

### Sample Output

The generated JSON file includes:

* **directory_structure**: The hierarchical structure of your directory, excluding specified folders.
* **metadata**: An object containing:
* **generation_timestamp**: Exact date-time of generation in ISO 8601 format with milliseconds and UTC timezone.
* **source_directory**: The source directory path.
* **target_directory**: The target directory path.
* **output_filename**: The name of the output JSON file.
* **skipped_directories**: An array of objects, each containing:
* **name**: Name of the skipped directory.
* **skipped_file_count**: Number of files skipped within that directory.
